# Dognation: Password Authentication

## Welcome to Dognation

Dognation is collaborative site for dogwalkers to share pictures of their buddies. People can sign in and post pictures of the dogs they walk and share them with everyone!
We were recently hired to complete a missing feature for the app! It currently doesn’t have any configuration to authenticate users. In this project, we’ll be using express-sessions, Passport’s passport-local, and bcrypt.js in order to authenticate users so they can register, login and stay, and log out of the app!
We’re provided with some boilerplate code that we’ll be modifying and adding to in order to complete this. Let’s get started!

###

Now that authentication has been implemented attempt to register a new user, then log them in, and finally log them out!
